      "* **Power:** Should be solid on.\n",
      "* **Internet/WAN:** Should be solid on or blinking.  If it's off or blinking erratically, there's a problem with the connection between your modem and your internet service provider (ISP).\n",
      "* **Wireless (WiFi):** Should be solid on or blinking. If it's off, check your router's WiFi button or settings.\n",

      "**3. Try a Different Device:**\n",

      "* See if you can connect to the internet using a different device (phone, laptop, tablet).  If another device works, the problem is with your original device, not the router.\n",

      "**4. Check the Router's Position:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* Make sure your router isn't obstructed by walls, metal objects, or electronic devices that could interfere with the signal.  Try moving it to a more central location.\n",

      "\n",
      "* Routers can overheat, especially in confined spaces.  Ensure it has adequate ventilation.\n",

      "**6. Check Your Internet Service Provider (ISP):**\n",
      "\n",
      "* There might be an outage in your area.  Contact your ISP to check the service status.\n",
      "\n",
      "**7. Update Router Firmware:**\n",

      "* Outdated firmware can cause problems.  Check your router manufacturer's website for instructions on how to update the firmware.  This usually involves accessing the router's settings page through a web browser.\n",

      "\n",
