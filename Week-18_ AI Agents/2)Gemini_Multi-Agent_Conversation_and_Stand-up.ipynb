      "(Chuckles, wiping a pretend sweat from his brow)  Oh man, Cathy, you’re killing me! That llama accountant joke… brilliant!  I love the dad-joke setup.  And the atom one?  Classic!  See, that’s what I’m talking about –  a good mix of observational and punny. My favorite?  I’m a sucker for a well-crafted observational joke. Something relatable, but with a twist. Like, you know, the struggle of trying to find a decent parking spot at the mall… but spun into something hilarious about the mating rituals of suburbanites.  (Pauses for laughter that isn’t there, then shrugs good-naturedly.) Anyway, you've got some real talent there, Cathy! You should think about hitting some open mics.  I gotta go!\n",
